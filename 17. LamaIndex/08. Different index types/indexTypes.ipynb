      "Repeat: The author spent time writing short stories and programming, starting with early experiences on an IBM 1401 in 9th grade using Fortran. Later, the author transitioned to microcomputers, building a Heathkit computer and eventually getting a TRS-80. This led to writing simple games, programs, and a word processor. Despite a plan to study philosophy in college, the author switched to AI due to interest sparked by a novel and a PBS documentary. This interest in AI continued through college and into graduate school, where the author eventually shifted focus to Lisp and writing a book on Lisp hacking.\n"
